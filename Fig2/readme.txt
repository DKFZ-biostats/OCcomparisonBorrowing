To reproduce Fig 2 of the manuscript, run the three programs

OneSample_Fixed_fixPP_dEgrid.R  with output: OneSampleFix_fixPP_delta0.5_nE20_dEgrid_alpha0.025.csv
OneSample_Fixed_EB_dEgrid.R  with output: OneSampleFix_EB_nE20_dEgrid_alpha0.025.csv
OneSample_Fixed_EB_dEgrid_extreme.R  with output: OneSampleFix_EB_nE1000_dEgrid_alpha0.025.csv

and subsequently 

plots_Onesample_Fixed_fixPP_EB_EBextreme_dEgrid.R

to get
